BDPA Triangle solution to the 2020 Problem Set


Set up local dev environment:

1. Make sure VS CODE is donwloaded on your machine
2. Create a folder on your local machine, I named mine after the repository for easy tracking
3. open the folder in VS code
4. run the shortcut:  ctrl + `   <-- thats a back tick btw
5. in the terminal you just opened run the following:  git clone https://github.com/afrokxt/triangle-hscc-2020.git
6. Follow the prompts 
7. Once your're all set up, Run: npm init  <-- this will install the necessary dependencies from the package.json
8. create a branch for your local environment: git branch yourName-whatYoureWorkingOn
9. switch to that branch: git checkout yourName-whatYoureWorkingOn 
10. Push the branch to the repository: git push --set-upstream origin yourName-whatYoureWorkingOn
